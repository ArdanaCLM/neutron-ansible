# NOTE: The vpnaas service relies on neutron-vpn-netns-wrapper which by default
# looks for the rootwrap.conf settings in /etc/neutron/rootwrap.conf, so we need
# to create a symlink under /etc/neutron pointing to the version that we are
# using for the l3 agent. We can remove this symlink once we figure out how to
# pass the --rootwrap_config={{ neutron_conf_dir }}/rootwrap.conf to the
# neutron-vpn-netns-wrapper when it is invoked.
