    msg:  "Setting up the systemd service for {{ neutron_service_cmd }}"

# NOTE: This setting impacts the restart_limit_interval setting, in that
# it changes the minimum time between restarts of a failed service and
# thus can impact whether the specified burst limit number of restart
# attempts could even happen within the specified interval.
- name: neutron-common | create_systemd_service | setup restart hold time
  set_fact:
    restart_hold: "{{ service_restart_hold | default('5s') }}"

# NOTE: The desired StartLimitInterval value really should be
# derived from the restart_hold and restart_limit_burst
# values, to ensure that our interval is slightly greater than the
# burst limit * (restart hold + time for service to fail startup).
# If a service overrides the default restart_hold setting, it should
# also override the restart_limit_interval setting with an appropriate
# value. The default value of 40 seconds here is based upon the desire
# to limit restarts to 5 at most in that interval allowing for the fact
# that there will be at least 5 seconds between restart attempts due to
# the default restart_hold setting, and allowing for up to 3 seconds of
# delay between starting the service and it failing.

# NOTE: This setting impacts the restart_limit_interval setting, in that
# it specifies how many restarts we allow within that interval, but the
# time between restart attempts is impacted by the restart_hold setting,
# so if this value is increased or decreased, the restart_limit_interval
# should be adjusted appropriately.
